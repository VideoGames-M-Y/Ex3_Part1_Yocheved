## Ex3 – Part 1: Changing and Improving the Game from the Lesson

**Objective**: 

To enhance gameplay mechanics by implementing a selected modification from a predefined list and introducing an original feature. The chosen modification involved creating a health system where the player begins with 3 health points, loses one upon colliding with an enemy, and can regain health through collectible power-ups.

Additionally, to fulfill the requirement for an original feature, a time power-up was introduced. This power-up freezes all enemies on the screen temporarily, giving the player a strategic advantage in evading threats or regaining control in challenging situations.

**Gameplay instructions**:
1. *controls:*
   * Use the arrow keys to navigate the player spaceship.
   * Use the space bar to shoot the laser at the enemy.
2. *Goals:*
   * Survive as long as possible by maintaining health points and utilizing power-ups effectively.
   * Health System: Check how the health counter changes upon collisions and when picking up health power-ups.
   * Time Power-Up: Use the power-up strategically to survive enemy waves or regain control in challenging situations.
3. *Game Over:*
   * The game ends when the player loses all their health points.
   * A "Game Over" screen will appear, displaying the player's score.
