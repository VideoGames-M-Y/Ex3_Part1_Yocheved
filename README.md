## Ex3 – Part 1: Changing and Improving the Game from the Lesson

**Objective**: 

To enhance gameplay mechanics by implementing a selected modification from a predefined list and introducing an original feature. The chosen modification involved creating a health system where the player begins with 3 health points, loses one upon colliding with an enemy, and can regain health through collectible power-ups.

Additionally, to fulfill the requirement for an original feature, a time power-up was introduced. This power-up freezes all enemies on the screen temporarily, giving the player a strategic advantage in evading threats or regaining control in challenging situations.
